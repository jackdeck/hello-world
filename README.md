I'm learning programming currently, using Head First series of books; HTML + CSS, JavaScript and HTML5. Excellent books, I highly recommend for anyone new to coding.
I'm also working through cs50 currently which I'm finding to be quite enlightening. Having spent over half my life either connected via umbilical or fully submerged within technology I've picked up some general knowledge along the way. My general ignorance of computer's inner workings though, has been a reality check.
I'd like to pick up some work with front-end web development to not only develop my skills but ideally to transition to coding full time. 
Down the track I'd love to be able to help integrate blockchain technology into a broad range of applications, I believe it is one of the technologies that has a potential to improve many people's lives.
